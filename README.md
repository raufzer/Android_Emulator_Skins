# • Google Android Emulator Skins
    This repository contains a collection of official Android emulator skins provided by Google. These skins allow you
    to test your apps on different device configurations without needing to own the physical devices themselves.

#    • Installation
    To use these skins, you will need to have the Android SDK installed on your computer. Once you have the SDK
    installed, you can download the skins by following these steps:

    <b>1.Open the Android SDK Manager
    <b>2.</b>Go to the "SDK Platforms" tab
    <b>3.</b>Select the version of Android you want to test your app on
    <b>4.</b>Go to the "SDK Skins" tab
    <b>5.</b>Select the skin you want to download
    <b>6.</b>Click the "Install" button
# • Usage
    To use these skins with the Android emulator, you will need to create a new virtual device using the skin. To do
    this, follow these steps:
    <br>
    <b>1.</b>Open the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager
    <br>
    <b>2.</b>Click the "Create Virtual Device" button
    <br>
    <b>3.</b>Choose a device definition that matches the skin you want to use
    <br>
    <b>4.</b>Select the skin from the "Skin" dropdown menu
    <br>
    <b>5.</b>Click the "Finish" button
    <br>
    Once you have created the virtual device, you can start it up and test your app on it just like you would with a
    physical device.
