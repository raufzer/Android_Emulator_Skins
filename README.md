    <h1>• Google Android Emulator Skins</h1>
    This repository contains a collection of official Android emulator skins provided by Google. These skins allow you
    to test your apps on different device configurations without needing to own the physical devices themselves.

    <h1>• Installation</h1>
    To use these skins, you will need to have the Android SDK installed on your computer. Once you have the SDK
    installed, you can download the skins by following these steps:
    <br>
    <b>1.</b>Open the Android SDK Manager
    <br>
    <b>2.</b>Go to the "SDK Platforms" tab
    <br>
    <b>3.</b>Select the version of Android you want to test your app on
    <br>
    <b>4.</b>Go to the "SDK Skins" tab
    <br>
    <b>5.</b>Select the skin you want to download
    <br>
    <b>6.</b>Click the "Install" button
    <br>
    <h1>• Usage</h1>
    To use these skins with the Android emulator, you will need to create a new virtual device using the skin. To do
    this, follow these steps:
    <br>
    <b>1.</b>Open the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager
    <br>
    <b>2.</b>Click the "Create Virtual Device" button
    <br>
    <b>3.</b>Choose a device definition that matches the skin you want to use
    <br>
    <b>4.</b>Select the skin from the "Skin" dropdown menu
    <br>
    <b>5.</b>Click the "Finish" button
    <br>
    Once you have created the virtual device, you can start it up and test your app on it just like you would with a
    physical device.
